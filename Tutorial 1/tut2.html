				<h2> What exactly is HTML? </h2>
				HTML, also known as Hyper Text Markup Language is a language used to create a website. Well, the entire functional and beautiful website needs other languages to be added but HTML works as a skeleton or support for the website without which an website cannot be created.

				<h2> What exactly is CSS? </h2>
				CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets is a language which is simply used to add beauty to a HTML website. When HTML acts as a skeleton, it cannot add required beauty or style to the actual website. So, for proper beauty and style to make the website look more attractive, CSS is used.

				<h2> What exactly is JS? </h2>
				JS, also known as Java Script is a programming language which is used to add logic or simply a brain to a website. While adding HTML & CSS can make the website look beautiful and attractive, it cannot make the website more interactive or functional which is why, Java Script is used on websites.

					<h2> Why to even do programming? </h2>
					Well, every technology we use, every app we run, every website we use is based on programming language and cannot run without it. Programming is not a must-do thingy as it is only for those who enjoy doing it. Not implying that you can't do it, instead, everyone can programm easily but it only depends on who can do the best. Everything we do, we must take it to pure perfection otherwise it won't be worth it and the same goes for programming. One who understands logic much much better and can bend codes to his/her own desire is the absolute best for programming. Nowdays, in the era of AI (Artificial Intelligence), you don't only need to be one of the best but you must be the best to get programming jobs. So, until or unless you are not ready, you must keep on practicing. Hence, programming is useful and we do it to make things easier for people who don't understand it.
